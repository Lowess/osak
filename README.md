`osaka` is meant to ease Ops teams daily tasks. It's a toolbox containing main Ops tools such as Ansible / Terraform / Hugo / Molecule. Each toolbox runs in a docker container.


## Installation

`osaka` comes as  ZSH plugin but it is not part of the official plugin list, so you need to install it manually:

* Edit your `~/.zshrc` and add `osaka` to the list of plugins to enable:

`plugins=( ... osaka )`

* In the command line, change to oh-my-zshâ€™s custom plugin directory and clone the repository:

`cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins && git clone https://github.com/Lowess/osaka osaka && cd && . ~/.zshrc`
